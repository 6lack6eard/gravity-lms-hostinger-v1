Right from the very beginning, it was our vision to impart quality education in conducive ambience where a kind of deep mutual understanding and trust develops between the mentors and the students. In this endeavor, we strived hard and slowly but steadily developed a system which is so simple and effective that results started trickling in. On a consistent basis, we produced over 3500 selections in IIT-JEE & over 3000 in various medical enterance examinations . One of our salient features is that we firmly believe that preparing for Boards and Competitive exams are not two different things. But should be merged with each other with such finesse and aplomb that an aspiring student remains least stressed and enjoys the rigors of the daunting challenge of performing superbly in both. Integration of both the Boards and competitive exams is designed, planned and executed at Gravity in excellent fashion. The basic thought is to synchronize the board curriculum with the preparation of competitive exams in the school premises during the regular school hours. This saves a lot of time and completely eradicates any possibility of duplication of efforts both on the part of the teachers as well as the students. We, at Gravity have immense faith not only in the abilities of quality mentors and receptive students but also in the equanimity of the teachers under long and arduous association spells.
